					TRAK Tool & Machine was started in 1986, incorporated in 1988.  Originally located in Ron Baileyâ€™s (founder) back yard, moved to our current location in 1987.  Die repair and maintenance for local automotive parts/stamping factories was its first niche, followed by new die building.  We have been known throughout Chatham-Kent for our custom machinery capabilities, which has led us to building dies, fixtures, and other custom machinery throughout Southern Ontario, US, Mexico and beyond.
